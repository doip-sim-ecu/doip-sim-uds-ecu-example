# DoIP-ECU Example based on UDS

#### Intro

This is an implementation of an ecu loosely implementing some services of the UDS standard. It exposes a gateway with 
an ecu behind it, as well as a REST-webservice to query/modify state. The purpose is to show an actual example of how 
the ecu-dsl could be used in testing.
